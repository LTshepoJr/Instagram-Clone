# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
I made a Instagram Clone in a day without pressure, faced challenges, conquer the challenges.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I used both flexbox and grid and both of them worked out for me well
- **Responsive Design**: need more practice, but I got it on point
- **Styling Elements**: I can style elements but more knowledge is needed to master CSS

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I had to search how to make it sizable on a phone screen and it worked out well because I got what I need and applied it and now it looks proper on screen
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: added them on parts that I thought it was needed the most

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I have to gain more knowlegde on them to apply them
- **Code Optimization**: I think I can fairly manage code.
- **Creative Design Choices**: need more design spec to try and go accordingly on my design, for me more inspiration is key

#### Overall Learning Experience
learned to work under presuure without being too overzealous
